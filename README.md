In this project, I decided to analyze the different languages that may have potentially been used in the novel, *Finnegan's Wake* by James Joyce. This is an interesting story because it is notoriously difficult to read within the literary world due to having an enormous vocabulary of about 250,000 words coming from approximately 60 different languages spanning across over 600 pages. As a result of this combination of words Joyce created, much of the actual content is very difficult to make sense of, almost seeming like sporadically placed words on a page. For this project, I have decided to try to figure out what some of the different languages are and how many of the words are from what language. From here, it can be branched out to find out what words may be the same but in a different language or just simply graphing these different proportions of languages out to examine the long list of vocabulary. To complete this project, I had to obtain an online PDF of the novel, open and read it through Python, proceed to tokenize it, and then categorize the tokens on of a variety of different languages. Nonetheless, it is a worthwhile project to start uncovering parts of the mysteries of the different languages within the novel as it is very hard to find answers to this question even just from a simple Google search. Additionally, it also reveals where some potential problems may lie in tackling a project such as this dealing with so many different words from so many different languages.
